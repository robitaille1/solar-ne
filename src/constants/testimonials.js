      'Solar Power New England installed our solar panels on our roof. They were very responsive, came to our house when they said they would come and installed a quality product. The job was completed in a timely fashion and they cleaned up the work area after every work day.  We are pleased with our solar installation.',

      "Positive Experience with Solar Power New England!!\n\nIt's so nice to deal with a company that is truly customer focused. I live in home owned by an extended family- all of whom had many questions about a potential solar project. Their questions were patiently answered. The installation process was efficient and careful - which is not always the case when service people encounter our nearly two hundred year old Victorian home. Since the panels have been up and running we've only encountered one minor software problem, and Andy Robitaille emailed me about it before I even had time to contact him! I'm VERY satisfied with our system and the service we've received from this company.",
