    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      From Gorham, Maine to Boston, Massachusetts...Solar Power New England
      began as a dream as many companies do.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having made a senior trip at the end of a college career at
      Northeastern University... It was in Costa Rica where we discovered that a
      renewable future was not only doable, but could be the bridge to building
      businesses with the essence of 'pura vida' at heart, and from the start.
      It was there that he travelled a country that is today, 100% powered by
      renewable energy, mainly by solar, wind and geothermal power.
    </p>
    <p>
      After careers in the IT industry, benefits administration, and financial
      planning, it all came together and the solar industry finally came around
      to begin hiring skillsets from multiple disciplines, environmental
      science, engineering, and even business disciplines. Federal tax
      incentives came into play, and the solar industry began to take off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon return, reflection, and research, it was then that the urgency was
      front and center. After having designed, sold and installed hundreds of
      systems for companies since, one common theme - most systems and solar
      installations are being done for those that have the financial means to
      afford it. Those that can't afford it, are also commonly victims of
      predatory billing, fees and inadequate housing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the lack of diversity in customer profiles and purchasers,
      it was also prevalent that the industry itself was woefully underdeveloped
      in a socially-responsible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, Solar Power New England was founded. SPNE's impact focus is to
      improve the lives of its neighbors, by developing and installing solar(PV)
      systems for those that can afford it, and promising a "profit-for-panels"
      turnaround for families and at-risk individuals in need, free of cost to
      their end users. Free installs, free equipment, and hopefully a little
      hope. Giving back is not something you're supposed to do once you can
      afford to do it... It's something we all have to do from the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Live simply so others may simply live, and give simply so others may
      simply give.
    </p>
    <p>Let's Change the world</p>
